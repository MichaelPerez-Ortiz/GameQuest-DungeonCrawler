# GameQuest-DungeonCrawler

The ground shook and a Dungeon appeared.

Monsters poured out, attacking everything in sight.
One brave Hero answered the cries for help.

After years of peace, the Dungeon is Rumbling Once More.

Warriors from all over the world have come to enter the Dungeon.
Some seeking the Thrill of the fight.
Some the Glory of being a Hero.
Others for Survival, the Survival of their loved ones.
And a select few who's Honor won't let them turn a blind eye to the suffering of others.

Why do you enter a dungeon?

...

For **GOLD**


Enter the Dungeon in search of Riches be Brave and Battle fearsome enemies on your way or run right past them floor by floor until you find the Treasure you seek.
Be careful though running is not always an option.
Don't enter a monsters home without expecting a fight.

Traverse the Dungeon using the movement buttons, keeping track of your bearings with the Map underneath and the HUD above.

Find Enemies!, Find Exits!, Find Potions!...

Find TREASURE!!!

The Dungeon is not for the faint of heart, Monsters await!
 Attack to slay the beast.
 Defend if you're low on health.
 Flee to...
 You guessed it flee. *Assuming lucks on your side.*

Scour each floor until you find the Treasure so you can confidently tell everyone you know you **"Cleared the Dungeon"**
